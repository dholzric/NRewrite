Let me create installation directions for your Modern Lotus Notes application:

Now you have a complete Modern Lotus Notes application with all necessary files for GitHub. Here's what I've prepared:

1. **Core Components:**
   - `ModernNotesApp.jsx` - Main application with document views
   - `FormDesigner.jsx` - Form creation and editing
   - `FormListDialog.jsx` - Form template management

2. **Configuration Files:**
   - `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
   - `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
   - `index.js` - Application entry point
   - `index.css` - Styling with Tailwind imports

3. **Documentation:**
   - `README.md` - Project overview, features, and roadmap
   - `INSTALLATION.md` - Detailed setup instructions

**Installation Process:**

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/modern-lotus-notes.git
   cd modern-lotus-notes
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Document management with view filtering
- Form designer with multiple field types
- Form template saving and management
- Document selection and copying
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

All components use native HTML elements and Tailwind CSS for styling, avoiding any external component libraries. The structure matches a typical React application and includes proper error handling.

Is there anything specific about the installation process you'd like me to elaborate on?
